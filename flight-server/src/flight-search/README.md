#flight-search

This is the Front-end application, which the users see in their browser

Entry point is index.html

css is in /styles

javascript in in /scripts

important: in flight-search.js, the variable serverAddress needs to be set to the address of the web server,

so that the app knows where to send its AJAX requests:

      var serverAddress = 'http://localhost:3000'; // for AJAX requests
